# Prodigy-Intern-T3-Tic-Tac-Toe-Web-application
This Tic-Tac-Toe game was developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a simple and interactive UI, allowing two players to compete against each other. It includes logic to detect winning combinations and highlights the winner, or declares a draw if no winning moves are left.
